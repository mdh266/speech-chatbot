    "----------------\n",
    "In my [last post](http://michael-harmon.com/blog/chatbot1.html) I went over how to create a create speech based chatbot app with a [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [Llama 3](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/), [Google Cloud API]() and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    " In this post I'll cover how to deploy this app using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization. Containerizing the app will allow us to run it both locally and on the cloud. Then I'll cover [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for automatically building the image and pushing it to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) where it can be pulled and run on [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) to create a serverless application."

    "[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the industry standard when it comes to containarizing applications. Containerization has made deploying applications and maintaining them across different environments much easier! Once a container is running on one computer it runs on all computers with Docker installed on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three things you should know about Docker are: [images, containers](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-docker-images-and-containers/) and [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/).\n",
    "\n",
    "A Docker image is a blue-print for a Docker container. A container is the instantiation of that image. This is similar to the way an object is an instantiation of a class in object oriented programing. The definition of an image is given by the Dockerfile. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Dockerfile for this project is pretty simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "    FROM python:3.11-slim\n",
    "\n",
    "    RUN mkdir /app\n",
    "    RUN mkdir /app/src\n",
    "    WORKDIR /app\n",
    "\n",
    "    COPY src /app/src\n",
    "    COPY pyproject.toml /app\n",
    "    COPY entrypoint.sh /app\n",
    "    RUN chmod +x /app/entrypoint.sh\n",
    "    RUN pip install . --no-cache \n",
    "\n",
    "    ENTRYPOINT [\"/app/entrypoint.sh\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "The two things that I will point out that are a little different is the use of `--no-cache` for pip installing our Python dependencies. By default pip stores the download packages in a cached directory so that subsequent installations of the same package will be faster.  However, since we dont need re-install anything in the container and the packages can take up signficant space (causing the images to bloat) I avoid caching them. Doing so made my image to be 618MB while with caching packages the image was 734MB. 100MB may not seem like much, but it's almost 20% larger with caching and in prior projects the images I made used tons of packages with caching and ended up using GBs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second point I'll call out is the use of the [entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/mdh266/thirdapp/blob/main/entrypoint.sh) script. For some reason it was not possible to run Streamlit on Google Cloud Run using the `streamlit run ...` command directly in the `ENTRYPOINT`, but invoking a Bash script  with that command in it did work and that's the reason for it!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Docker image can be built from the Dockerfile using the command,\n",
    "\n",
    "    docker image build -t <image_name> .\n",
    "\n",
    "The container can be run using the command,\n",
    "\n",
    "    docker run -ip 8080:8080 -e GROQ_API_KEY=<your-groq-api> -e GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-google-api>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice I had to use `-ip 8080:8080` to perform [port-forwarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) from the container to my machine. I used port 8080 instead of Streamlit's default port of 8051 since Google Cloud Run uses port 8080 and its easy enough to switch ports in Docker. I also pass the API keys in as environment variables to the container using the `-e` syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NEVER load your `.env` file in your image or set your API keys in the image. If you do then anyone can get them when they get access to the image!**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a little bit annoying to have to pass this environment variables all the time, especially as you use more and more API keys, so for local development I used [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and the following [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/mdh266/thirdapp/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file,\n",
    "\n",
    "    services:\n",
    "        app:\n",
    "            build: .\n",
    "            env_file: \".env\"\n",
    "            ports:\n",
    "            - \"8080:8080\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the `app` specifies building the image and the `env_file` variable specifies my \".env\" file with my API keys. This is **okay** since Docker Compose will inject the environment variables into the container and not into the image! \n",
    "\n",
    "You can start up the container with the command,\n",
    "\n",
    "    docker compose up\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the site should be running on https://localhost:8080.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part to this section is a discussion of [DockerHUB](https://hub.docker.com/). DockerHub is a repository used to host Docker images that can used to pull images from and run them on different platforms. I used DockerHub to host the image so that I could pull it and run it from Google Cloud Run. The command to push the image to DockerHub is,\n",
    "\n",
    "    docker push mdh266/thirdapp:cloudrun\n",
    "\n",
    "where `mdh266` is my DockerHub account name, `thirdapp` is the name of the image and `cloudrun` is the tag for the version. One problem that I had was I used a M1 based Apple computer to build the image and had trouble running it on a Linux machine on Google. This is a [known problem](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-build-problems-mac/) and I used this as an opportunity to build the image on a Linux machine using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)."
